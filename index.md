## About me
<div align="justify"> 
Ajibode Adekunle is currently a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Queen's University, Kingston, Canada, specializing in optimizing the release management of Natural Language Processing models. He is conducting his research in the Maintenance, Construction and Intelligence of Software/Software Analysis and Intelligence Lab (MCIS/SAIL) under the supervision of Professor Bram Adams.
He earned his Master's degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology in the School of Information Science and Technology at Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, China, under the supervision of Professor Shu Ting. His MSc thesis is titled "Spectrum-based Fault Localization Method Using Formulas Combination."
He received his BSc(Ed) in Computer Science from Tai Solarin University of Education, Ijagun, Ijebu Ode, Nigeria, under the supervision of Dr. Ogunyinka in 2014.
Ajibode also holds a Nigerian Certificate in Education, a teacher's training certificate in Computer Science and Mathematics from the Federal College of Education, Osiele, Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria.
He has been a teacher since 2005 and has mentored many students at the pre-school, high school, and post-secondary school levels.
